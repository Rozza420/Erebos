									<h1>Review of Erebos</h1>
									<p>By Courtney Slater</p>
								</header>
								<p>Erebos is a novel written by Ursula Poznanzki. The book takes the elements of teen life and places it in a setting of a completely different world of hiding behind a screen and keeping secrets from everyone. I have never read a book like this one, it was actually appealing for me to read and made me curious to know more which caused me to continue reading it. It never failed to keep things interesting and had plenty of twists that will keep you on edge, I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read.  <br/>
									The novel is revolved around the life of a 16 year old boy named Nick Dunmore who lives in England and lives a pretty ordinary life for a teenager. Nick is living his life as he normally would but that all changes when he notices changes in everyone's behavior at school, even Nick’s best friend, Colin, is acting strangely and Nick becomes more curious when Colin receives a mysterious package, which he’d seen the other students sharing around secretly. Nick questions everyone he has seen with the mysterious content, but no one will give him any answers, until a girl called Brynne pulled him aside and gave him one of these packages. After following the strict instructions Nick became involved in the big secret ‘EREBOS’.<br/>
									The game is fun and interesting for Nick, as he likes the graphics that are highly detailed and with a realistic impression; one interesting concept is the music and how it places Nick into a trance-like state, and the other characters act like living people of the real world except with more ego and attitude. What was most intriguing to me was reading how Nick’s curiosity turn into a hard obsession. For when Nick first received the game he was playing it carefully in a way as if he was afraid of what would happen if he was overconfident. But as time progresses and the game progresses he began to enjoy the game, no matter the strict and strange rules which enforced his silence of the game, never revealing his real name in the game, and never exposing the name of his character outside of the game.<br/>
									Nick had to create a character to play the game, the character that Nick creates he believes is the best reflection of him and so the dark elf knight Sarius was born. The author seems to describe Nick and his character ,Sarius, as one person and often wrote in first person when actions were done in the game, saying things like I did this or I did that, but when in reality, the person doing those things was Nick’s character, not Nick himself. I enjoyed seeing the author’s interpretation of how video games seem to hide the line between reality and fiction and make a person lose oneself in a video game, But the use of reality in Erebos changed the whole idea of a game and turned it into something more.<br/>

									One character that did not play amongst the others seemed to be the leader of the game  he went by the name of ‘ The Messenger’, gave Nick and anyone who played strange tasks to follow inside and outside of the game. This was one of the most interesting aspects of the novel. The inception of the real world into a video game. Nick at first refused to carry out his first task and causing the messenger to threaten banishment or “death” from the game. Nick then agrees to the task and starts to really play the game, with having completed the task Nick learns that when he does what he is told he gets rewarded with a gift in both the game and life making the tasks seem worthwhile. This is where his obsession for the game starts he can’t stop thinking about it and it brings him to act out in a totally different manner from his original nature, he skips school, and disobeys his parents in order to play it, the game has a ‘hold’ on him which he refuses to admit or control.<br/>
									When Nick refuses a task from the Messenger, “killing” his character and expelling him from the game. He seeks help from some people who are fighting the game the people who have played it and “died” and are now looking for answers about it. With the help of those people, along with his love interest, Emily, Nick sets out to find out the truth behind the game, who is controlling it and why are they doing it.<br/>
									The book was so well written that I want there to be a second one,the plot of the book is overflowing with mystery and kept me guessing about the identity of the person behind the Messenger the true mastermind behind the game, the one pulling the strings of the characters making them carry out his bidding. Poznanzki created such a strong atmosphere that it seemed to have placed me into the book and game with Nick.<br/>
									I rate this book a 4 out of 5 because though it was a fantastic book I felt that it took a bit too much time to get into the more interesting part of the game.

									<h1>Review of Erebos</h1>
									<p>By Ruairi Murphy</p>

								<p>Erebos, is a fantasy fiction novel by Ursula Poznanski. The book is very deep and involves many layers of the inner workings of the gaming company wars in england and across the world.  The book is set in a modern day setting and most things in the book are able to happen in the world we live in today which is quite scary and that is one of the many reasons this book is so engaging. The characters in this novel are great, very consistent throughout and are obviously very thought out making them seem very real which in turn makes you sympathise with them and their feelings. The depth of the story is very engaging and at sometimes felt confusing, but after a short time it was simple again and i could understand it all.  The text was also very intense at some points and made me feel as if it was real, which could easily happen, in the world we live in at this point of time. Overall I believe this book is very realistic and it almost creates a sense of realism. I would rate this book a 9/10.</p>
